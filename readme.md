# AI Resume Matching Microservice

A powerful microservice that uses AI to match resumes with job descriptions, providing detailed scoring and analysis for recruitment professionals.

## üöÄ Overview

This microservice leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide sophisticated resume parsing and job matching capabilities. The system analyzes resumes against job descriptions using standardized evaluation criteria with role-specific adaptations for more accurate matching results.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Extract structured data from PDF, DOCX, and plain text resumes
- **Intelligent Job Matching**: Score resumes against job descriptions with a comprehensive weighted scoring system
- **Role-Specific Evaluation**: Automatically adapt evaluation criteria based on job type/industry
- **Detailed Analysis**: Receive comprehensive match reports with strengths, weaknesses, and specific insights
- **Red Flags & Bonus Points**: Identify potential concerns and standout qualities in candidates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The microservice is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

1. **API Layer** (`app.py`): Flask-based REST API for handling client requests
2. **Resume Parser** (`resume_parser.py`): Extracts structured data from various resume formats
3. **Job Matcher** (`job_matcher.py`): Calculates match scores using standardized criteria
4. **Role Evaluator** (`role_evaluator.py`): Adapts evaluation based on job types
5. **Response Formatter** (`response_formatter.py`): Formats responses according to required templates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for the API
- **Google Gemini AI**: AI model for natural language processing tasks
- **PyPDF2 & docx2txt**: Libraries for extracting text from files
- **OpenTelemetry**: For observability and monitoring
- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection
